# sitetweaks
A collection of user styles to modify the appearance of websites

Reasons to modify existing sites are usually:
* to hide features I don't use, to avoid distractions;
* to give features I do use a more prominent place or appearance;
* to make reading information easier with my eyesight;
* to make interacting with sites easier with my motor skills.
